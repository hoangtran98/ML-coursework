<p>This contains all exercies I have done upon taking Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in 2020. </p>
<p>The exercises help me gain understanding of basic machine learning concepts and models (such as linear regression, logistic regression, knn and more)</p>
<p>These materials were part of previous version of the course. All of my work were implemented in Octave as suggested by the course author.</p>
